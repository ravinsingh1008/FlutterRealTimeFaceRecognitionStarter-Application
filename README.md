# realtime_face_detection

A new Flutter project.

Key Features:

Real-time Face Detection: 
            Accurately detects faces in live camera feeds.
Efficient Model Integration: 
            Seamlessly integrates TensorFlow Lite models for face recognition.
User-Friendly Interface: 
            Provides a clean and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.
Customizable Model Support: 
            Allows for the integration of custom-trained models.
Clear Code Structure: 
            Well-organized codebase for easy understanding and modification.

Getting Started:

Clone the Repository:

Set Up Environment:

Ensure you have Flutter and Dart SDK installed.
Set up a TensorFlow Lite development environment.
Install Dependencies:

Bash
flutter pub get
Use code with caution.

Run the App:

Bash
flutter run

Use code with caution.

How It Works:

Camera Access: The app requests camera permission to capture live video frames.
Face Detection: A TensorFlow Lite model is used to detect faces within each frame.
Face Recognition: Detected faces are fed into a face recognition model for identification.
Display Results: Recognized faces are highlighted or labeled on the screen.
Potential Applications:

Access Control: Implement facial recognition for secure access to buildings or devices.
Security Surveillance: Monitor public spaces and identify suspicious individuals.
User Authentication: Enable secure logins and transactions using facial biometrics.
Augmented Reality: Create immersive AR experiences that interact with users' faces.
Emotion Recognition: Analyze facial expressions to understand user sentiment.
